The image is a QR code, which is a type of matrix barcode. It consists of a grid of black squares arranged on a white grid. The QR code is designed to be scanned by a camera or a smartphone to retrieve information encoded within it. The pattern includes three larger squares at three corners of the grid, which are used for alignment and orientation during scanning. The rest of the grid is filled with smaller squares that encode the data.
